Based on this lab, why is using branches a powerful and safe way for software engineers to collaborate on a single project? What simple problems might it prevent?

Branches are a powerful and safe way for software engineers to collaborate on a single project because it allows them to work in their own separate environments.
Each software engineer can work on their feature of the project in their own branch and be able to upload everything to a main branch which hosts all of their code.
Merging each other's code can cause conflicts but that's why Git and Github are powerful.
Git and Github detects those conflicts and lets the software engineers know which portion of the code to fix.
